            <h1>Poképass</h1>
            <p>Use this handy tool to translate between Pokémon names and their Pokédex numbers, to build/remember secure passwords.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    More...
                </summary>
                <p>Remembering passwords is a pain, isn't it? Our brains just aren't designed for memorising all those numbers. But hey, you know what we are built for? Memorising Pokémon!</p>
                <h2>Creating a Poképass</h2>
                <p>Enter the password you want to remember into the "Password" field, as you type you should see the "Pokémon" field fill up.</p>
                <h2>Retrieving a Poképass</h2>
                <p>Enter the names of all the Pokémon from when you made your Poképass, separated by commas. Any other text in your password, just put in quotation marks, like this: "AshKetchum"</p>
                <h3>How Poképass stores your data</h3>
                <p>It doesn't! This site is not connected to <b>any</b> database, nothing you type here will leave your own browser and computer. You can even check the code yourself <a href="http://github.com/TEParsons/pokepass">here</a>.</p>
                <h3>How secure is the randomiser?</h3>
                <p>Not very. I'm not a security expert, I'm a passable programmer who likes Pokémon. The randomiser uses very basic JavaScript randomise functions, and the code is open source. For a more secure password, you should try something like <a href="https://www.avast.com/random-password-generator">Avast's generator</a>. Of course, you're quite welcome to then Pokéfy it here!</p>
